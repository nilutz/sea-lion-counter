This is the 37th place solution to the "NOAA Fisheries Steller Sea Lion Population Count" Kaggle Challenge. It is based on a ImageNet pre-trained [Inception-v4 network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261) and [Count-ception](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08710). Our major change to Count-ception was to reduce the size of the targets to a smaller resolution than the input resolution. Thereby, we substantially reduced the duration until convergence. Special care was taken to provide additional inputs to the network such that it can see animals beyond the boundaries of the image patches that are fed to the network. The network achieved an RMSE of around 8 on a local validation set, but only around 19.45 on the public LB. The reason for that is possibly that the public set has a slightly different scaling that our network does not generalize to very well.
